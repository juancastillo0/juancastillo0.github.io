Juan Manuel Castillo's homepage: Contact information, general interests, technologies, projects and trajectory.


 ### Objective
 The main objective of the homepage is to show contact information, my general interests and the projects I have been working on.
 
 
 ### Technologies 
 This proyect uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For styling and layout it uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), for fonts [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and the icons are from [Material.io](https://material.io/resources/icons/).
 
 
 ### Prerequisites
 All the prerequisites are already in the repository, no need to install anything more. To run the repository locally you can use any application to serve up static HTML files, during development, I used [reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reload).
